# Welcome to Cards ðŸ‘‹

A side-project that allows users to buy packs of cards using earned in-game credits.
You can collect, battle with, and trade cards with other players.

- Perhaps consider PocketBase (Firebase even?)
- Players can only trade cards locally when next to each other (using Bluetooth, GPS, and other forms to verify proximity)
- Players can battle each other to gain credits/and XP?
- Players can buy and open packs of cards that can contain rare cards
- Players will be able to see a global leaderboard
- Players can earn credits by completing daily tasks/watching ads etc that can help with generating revenue
- Opening packs of cards will always have a wow factor, and cards must look amazing/feel special and rare
